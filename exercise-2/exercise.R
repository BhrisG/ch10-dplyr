### Exercise 2: Data Frame Practice with dplyr

## This exercise need the "fueleconomy" package.  Install and load it.
## You should have have access to the `vehicles` data.frame

## Install (if you haven't already) and load the `dplyr`package

# You should have have access to the `vehicles` data.frame


# Create a data.frame of vehicles from 1997


# Use the `unique` function to verify that there is only 1 value in the `year` column of your new data.frame


# Create a data.frame of 2-Wheel Drive vehicles that get more than 20 miles/gallon in the city


# Of those vehicles, what is the vehicle ID of the vehicle with the worst hwy mpg?


# Write a function that takes a `year` and a `make` as parameters, and returns 
# The vehicle that gets the most hwy miles/gallon of vehicles of that make in that year


# What was the most efficient honda model of 1995?
